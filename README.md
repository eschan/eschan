# Hi, Thanks for stopping by! 👋

I'm a Software Engineer based in Los Angeles, CA (actually a city 35 miles east, [Claremont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claremont,_California)).  Currently VP of Product Engineering @ [Second Spectrum](https://www.secondspectrum.com).

## Intresting Fact
I always introduce myself as `Edward`, but everyone ends up calling me `Ed`. 

## Engineering Skills and Topics I'm currently interested in
* Managing Engineering Teams
* Mentorship, Coaching, and Learning
* Blurring the line between Engineering and Product
* Systems Architectures
* Systems Thinking
